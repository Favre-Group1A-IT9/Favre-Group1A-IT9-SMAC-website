                <p>SMAC is a non-profit, non-stock organization that was created as a result of the observation of the living situations of the underprivileged parishioners and families who are unable to provide for their members' health care, education, adequate nutrition, hygiene, and morale. Its overarching objective is to raise children who are psychologically and socially mature, who live and practice Christian ideals, who share their religion with their peers, and who enjoy life to the fullest. It gives the kids an education by enrolling them in school, from kindergarten through college, and also gives them the opportunity to learn how to make a living by baking and cooking. It also offers various medical treatments, psychological support, fun and engaging programs, and spiritual upliftment. The children are SMAC's main recipients of the primary beneficiaries.

                <h3>Problem Facing:</h3>
                <p>
                    We are focusing on the problem of lack of funds, especially for psychological assessments for the children since based on the research made about SMAC and the affordability of SMAC.<br><br>
                <h3>How can this project help?</h3>
                Our project aims to help solve their problem, not only for the ability to afford do psychological assessments but also to help them with their financial problems and the childrenen. Since our project, it is basically a garage sale we could use it to raise funds and donate it to the institution. Not only we are able to help in their financial state, but we are also able to teach and earn skills. On our projects side, we are able to do MAGIS, the the ability to do more, and the value of Men and Women for others.

                History ｡^‿^｡
                <br>
                Relevant circumstances that have led to the creation of this institution was child abandonment or neglect, economic incapacity, malnutrition, and poverty. This institution seeked out children who were neglected, abandoned, and even orphaned children living in the streets. Children who were living in extreme poverty to the point some of them are malnourished, lacked hygiene, or was even exposed to violence or sexual abuses. This institution focused on improving these children’s lives through education, restoring their dignity as human beings by giving them a home where they can feel love and care. They wanted to give these children better lives and to be strong in faith instead of being out in the streets living in poverty without getting enough education, care, and support.
